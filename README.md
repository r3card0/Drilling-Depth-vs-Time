# Depth vs Days Plot
* The objective is to show a workflow of how to plot a drilling depth vs time chart for a single well and create a pdf file.
* The planned and actual depths are going to added.

## Steps to deploy project
1. Define a local directory  
2. Create a virtual environment ```python3 -m venv name```
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install python libraries: ```pip install pandas matplotlib```
5. Open [singlewell.py](https://github.com/r3card0/Drilling-Depth-vs-Time/blob/main/singlewell.py) file and set the planned/actual data from line ```6``` to line ```12``` and set the name of the well on line ```48```
6. Run script [singlewell.py](https://github.com/r3card0/Drilling-Depth-vs-Time/blob/main/singlewell.py) and look the pdf file created of.
